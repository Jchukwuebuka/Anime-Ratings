            <b>Description:</b>
            <p>The Golden City of the Scorching Sun starts things off by torturing a new child character, Vuelo Eluko – Made in Abyss is back and darker than ever. Now in the sixth layer, Reg, Riko, and Nanachi steadily make their way to the eponymous city, a surreal land that can go from picturesque to horrifying in the blink of an eye. The anime intercuts the trio's tense adventure with flashbacks or voice-overs covering a previous group's expedition to the Golden City, firmly establishing that this is a journey with no return trip.</p>
            <p>As with Made in Abyss's previous installments, The Golden City of the Scorching Sun is an uncomfortable but mesmerizing watch. Each step seems like it could be the last for the anime's lovable but vulnerable protagonists, and that's a feeling few stories are able to create and maintain. So far, Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun is the best Summer 2022 anime.</p>

            <li>Genre: Action, comedy</li>

            <p>An original anime, Lycoris Recoil started strong and has only gotten better since then. Set in a familiar but slightly futuristic world, Tokyo's peace is kept by an organization that hides operatives known as Lycoris within general society in order to stop crimes before they get going. To blend in, these agents dress as high school girls.</p>
            <p>Following a botched operation, Takina gets booted out of the group's main hub and sent to one of its associates, a café called LycoReco, so she can improve her teamwork. There, she meets Chisato, a talented and carefree agent who shows her new partner that she does not have to follow the standard Lycoris method to become everything she can be. Takina and Chisato complement each other beautifully, with the latter helping the former to come out of her shell. Lycoris Recoil's action sequences are top-notch, not only in terms of animation but also in the way they expand on the characters' personalities.</p>
